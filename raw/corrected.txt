PREFACE 



My chief object in writing the following Grammar has
been to furnish specialists in English philology with an
accurate account of the Phonology and Accidence of one
of the most interesting of the Yorkshire dialects. And in
order to make the work as useful as possible to this class
of scholars, I have taken special care to include in the
Phonology fairly complete lists of the words which are in
common use in the dialect and also exist in the literary
language. This method of treatment has sometimes in-
volved me in great difficulties; because in the case of words
which seem to have had an abnormal development I could
not always decide with certainty whether the seeming
irregularities had arisen within the dialect itself, or
whether the words in question had been introduced from
the literary language at various periods, or were merely
borrowings from some neighbouring dialect. These are
difficulties which every writer of a scientific dialect gram- 
mar has to contend with. But it would manifestly have
been dishonest on my part to have omitted any word or
form which did not seem to have had a regular develop-
ment. The result is that the grammar contains dozens
of words the vocalism of which I have not been able to

a3 

---

vi PREFACE. 

explain satisfactorily, but I have nevertheless registered
them in separate paragraphs, as being in common use in
the dialect and of equal importance to the English philo-
logist. Out of a great many such examples I will only
mention a few here : nuəz (OE. nosu) nose, biəd (OE.
beard) beard, ut (OE. hāt) hot, friət (OE. fretan) to fret, for
which we should expect in the dialect noiz (§§ 105, 109),
bād (§§ 61, 68), uət (§§ 122, 126), freit (§§ 82, 87). On the
other hand, the present grammar will, I trust, help to throw
some light upon Old English vowel quantities, besides
showing how dialects still keep apart many vowel sounds
which have fallen together in the literary language. Of
the latter I will only mention a few examples, although
a great many may be found in the grammar : — jād (OE.
geard) yard, jiəd (OE. gerd) yard, three feet, wāk (OE.
weorc) work, wə¯k (OE. wyrcan) to work. meil (OE. melu)
meal, flour, miəl (OE. mǣl) meal, repast. reit (OE. reoht,
reht) right, rait (OE. wrītan) to write, rīt (OE. wyrhta)
wright.

In the treatment of the native element contained in the
grammar I have generally started out from Old English,
which in some respects presents fewer difficulties to the
writer of a modern dialect grammar than Middle English
with its numerous dialects. Had I, however, been a
specialist in this period of our mother tongue, I should
probably have been able to settle many minor points which
remain unsolved in the present grammar. But still, in
spite of my shortcomings in this respect, I hope that the
book will be a welcome contribution to English philology.

In the treatment of the French element in the dialect 
I found, after trying many experiments, that the only 


---

PREFACE. vii 

satisfactory plan was to start out from the present pro-
nunciation of literary English. The words have come into
the dialect at various periods and through various chan-
nels, and it is accordingly almost impossible to treat them
historically. I have therefore contented myself with
registering the present dialectical pronunciation of the
French element, and for this purpose I have adopted, as
the standard of literary English pronunciation, the sound-
system in Sweet's Primer of Spoken English, which is fairly
typical of the Southern pronunciation of educated people.
A comparison of the development of the French and English
elements in the dialect is interesting from many points of
view. I will only draw attention to §§ 61, 203 and §§ 58,
202; but many other paragraphs will be found equally in-
teresting both to English and French philologists. Any one,
who is not thoroughly acquainted with the dialect, may
possibly think that I have introduced into this part of the
grammar many words which are not in common use; but
such is not the case. I have been particularly careful in
this respect. I will only mention one instance out of
many where I may seem to have erred: raiət akt riot
act, which is one of the commonest expressions in the
dialect, a regular household phrase. What mother has not
said to her naughty child hundreds of times, if tə duz ðat
ə˙gien al rīd ðī traiət akt ən reit ən oel?

In the chapter on the consonants the chief interest
naturally lies in the gutturals. In this part of the gram-
mar I have tried to give complete lists of the words which
differ in their development from literary English, I mean
such words as: flik flitch, reik to reach, brig bridge, flig 
fledge, duəf dough, etc. 

---

viii PREFACE. 

It was originally my intention not to give any speci-
mens of the dialect in this volume, but to reserve them for
a second which was to contain a complete glossary of
such dialect words as are not in use in the Modern literary
language, together with extensive specimens of the dialect.
With this end in view I have been collecting materials for
a great number of years, but various circumstances pre-
vent me from entertaining the hope of being able to
publish them for some years to come. I have therefore
decided to give a few specimens in the present volume,
trusting that they may be found useful to those readers
who may wish to make themselves familiar with the
dialect. To anyone who takes the trouble to read them
I venture to say that they will be found both amusing and
instructive.

The Index, which has been a laborious piece of work,
contains all the words occurring in the grammar.

As a guarantee for the general accuracy of the material
contained in the book, I need only state that I spoke the
dialect pure and simple until I was practically grown up.

In conclusion I have the pleasant task of expressing my
most cordial thanks to three friends — Professor Napier,
Professor Holthausen, and the Rev. A. L. Mayhew — who
have given me much valuable help in the work.

GRAMMAR



INTRODUCTION.

§ 1. Windhill is a manufacturing village in the
township of Idle and parish of Calverley in the West
Riding of Yorkshire, three miles North of Bradford.

The dialect belongs to the Eastern North Midland group,
which embraces the whole of South Yorkshire. Dr. Ellis
(EEPr. v. p. 364) distinguishes nine varieties: The Western
group containing var. 1. Huddersfield and var. 2. Halifax.
The North Central group containing var. 3. Keighley,
var. 4. Bradford, var. 5. Leeds, var. 6. Dewsbury. The
South Central group containing var. 7. Rotherham and
var. 8. Sheffield. The Eastern group containing var. 9.
Doncaster and the Eastern slip.

Of these nine varieties the Windhill dialect is most
closely related to numbers 3. 4. 5.

PHONOLOGY


CHAPTER I.

PRONUNCIATION.

A. The Vowels.

§ 2. The Windhill dialect contains the following vowel
sounds:—

Short vowels a, e, i, o, u, ə

Long „ ā, ī, ū, ə¯

Short diphthongs ai, ei, oi, ui
eu, iu, ou
eə, iə, oə, uə 
Long „ āə 

Triphthongs aiə, iuə, ouə

Note. — To these must be added l, m, n, ŋ in the function of vowels. For 
examples see the corresponding consonants §§ 17-19.

§ 3. In the following paragraphs will be given a brief
description of the Windhill vowel-system. For which pur-
pose I have adopted the notation as given in Sweet's
Primer of Phonetics. In the autumn of 1886 Dr. Sweet
was kind enough to render me considerable help in the
analysis of the W. vowel sounds; thus enabling me to fix


---

§§ 3, 4.] PRONUNCIATION OF VOWELS. 3 

the sounds far more accurately than would otherwise have
been the case, had it not been for his kind assistance.
The late Dr. Ellis, to whom I dictated the Dialect Test
(EEPr. v. pp. 389-90) and the dialect words in his Classi-
fied Word List (pp. 391-4), was also of some help to me.
But a comparison of his appreciation of the W. vowels
with that of Dr. Sweet and my own will show that we
differ on several minor points.

All the diphthongs and triphthongs have the stress on
the first element. In my transcription I have written iə,
uə, &c., but the first element is really a medium long
vowel, which stands in the same relation to the corre-
sponding short vowel as the lit. Engl, vowel in feet does
to fit or seek to sick.

§ 4. a (mid-back-wide) like the a in German Mann,
but with the tongue slightly more advanced.

lat late, faðə(r) father, mak to make, as to ask, laðə(r)
ladder, dlad glad, tšap chap, ratn rat, pastə(r) pasture,
aprən apron, kwaləti quality, vari very.

ā (mid-back-wide) like the a in German Name and in
lit. Engl, father, but with slightly more advanced position
of the tongue as in short a. After our ā there is also
a trace of a glide (ā^ə), which however is not sufficiently
developed to be conveniently represented in print.

rām room, fāl fowl, bān child, wām warm, wāk (noun)
work, fādin farthing, sāvnt servant, pāðə(r) powder.

ai=a+i:

raiv to tear, mais mice, tais to entice.

aiə=ai+ə:

aiən iron, faiə(r) fire, raiət riot.

āə=ā+ə:

dāə(r) dare, sāə(r) sour, tāə(r) tower.

§ 5. e (low-front-narrow) like the ä in Swed. lära and
the first element of the diphthong in lit. Engl. care but
short. Ellis identified it as mid-front- wide, but Sweet and
myself agree in the above analysis.

wash, bleg blackberry, geðə(r) to gather, ðen then, šepstə(r)
starling, len to lend, gezlin gosling, depþ depth, lek to leak,

fligd fledged, dwinl to dwindle, litl little, sili silly, ivə(r) 
ever, rik smoke, divl devil, tšimli, chimney, šimi chemise. 

ī (high-front-narrow) like the ie in German Biene. It is 
a pure long vowel, not like the ee in South. Engl, feed, 
which is a diphthong (ij): 

mīld mild, nīt night, fīld field, wīl (adv.) well, frīt fright, 
bīld to build, īmin evening, kīl to cool, lītnin lightning, sī 
sigh, nī knee, bīf beef. 

iə = i + ə: 

biəd beard, iəþ earth, swiə(r) to swear, friət to fret, fliə(r) 
to laugh or sweer at, driəd to dread, tliən clean, briəd 
bread, biə(r) beer, viəl veal, fiəs fierce.

§ 6-8.] PRONUNCIATION OF VOWELS. 5 

iu = i + u: 

tliu a ball of string or worsted, spiu to vomit, tiuk took, 
lium loom, iniu (pl.) enough, briu to brew, frutə(r) future, 
bliu blue, riubub rhubarb. 

iuə = iu + ə: 

siuə(r) sure, piuə(r) pure. 

§ 7. o (low-back-wide-round) like the o in lit. Engl, 
not: 

frozn frozen, lop flea, bodi body, wotə(r) water, solt salt, 
moni many, jolə yellow, sori sorry, tof tough, fotnit fort-
night, kotn cotton, ont aunt, rost to roast. 

oi = o + i: 

þoil to give ungrudgingly, boil to boil, toist toast. 

ou = o + u. But here the first element is low-back-narrow- 
round like the aw in lit. Engl, law: 

koud cold, doutə(r) daughter, floun flown, kouk coke, 
grou to grow, þout thought, loup to jump, out ought, tout 
taught, poutš to poach, skoud to scald. 

ouə = ou + ə: 

fouə(r) four. 

oə = o + ə, the first element of which is the same as the o 
in ou: 

koəf calf woəf insipid, boək beam, boəld bald, poəm 
palm, soəv salve, moək maggot, boən bom, noəðə(r) neither,

the W. dialect it is a pure long vowel and not a diphthong 
(uw) like the oo in Southern Engl, food: 

šūl shovel, əbūn above, būkþ bulk, size. 

ui = u + i. The first element of which is not the u in 
put. Dr. Ellis identified the first element as mid-back- 
narrow-round like the o in Germ. Bote, but this is cer- 
tainly not the sound. At first Dr. Sweet gave the same 
analysis as Dr. Ellis, but he was afterwards inclined to 
think that it might be mid-back-narrow-round with outer 
rounding like the o in Swedish sol. But this too is hardly 
our sound. The nearest analysis seems to me to be the 
tongue position of high-back-narrow-round, like the u in 
Germ, gut, ou in French sou, with the lip position of mid- 
back-narrow-round: 

bluid blood, uin to harass, treat badly, gruin snout of 
a pig. 

uə = u + ə. The first element is the same as the u in ui: 

nuəz nose, smuə(r) to smother, duə(r) door, juək yolk, 
kuəm comb, duəf dough, dluə(r) to stare, kuəd cord, tluək 
cloak, puə(r) poor. 

§ 9. e (mid -mixed-narrow) like the e in German Gabe, 
but with the tongue slightly more retracted. It is not 
identical with the -er in lit. Engl, better, which is mid- 
mixed-wide. It occurs in both stressed and unstressed 
syllables : 

J9st9d9 yesterday, stgrgk heifer, fQVQ furrow, W9ri to 
worry, b9d but, sp9rit spirit, val9 value. 

§ (low-mixed-narrow) like the i in lit. Engl, bird, but 
with the tongue rather more advanced. It only occurs in 
stressed syllables : 

g§s grass, b§k birch, W9d word, m§S9(r) murder, w§k 
to work, k§smos Christmas, g§t great, k§nz currants.

§ 22. r (gum-open- voice). Before a following vowel r 
is a gently trilled sound. Final r is also slightly trilled, 
but not so strongly as before a following vowel. This is 
always the case when the word containing it is used alone, 
or stands at the end of a sentence. In these positions it is 
never weakened into a mere voiced glide as in lit. Engl, 
fear, nor does it disappear altogether as in lit. Engl. far. 
In order to distinguish strong and weak r the latter is 
uniformly written (r) in this grammar : 

raiv to tear, roat to bray, roam to roam, reik to reach, 
ram room, brek to break, rer> wrong, sare to serve, mare to 
match, feri first turn, bare barrow, ger up to get up.

CHAPTER III. 

THE VOWELS TEEATED HISTORICALLY. 

The Vowels of Accented Syllables. 

In treating the vowels in accented syllables it is necessary 
to distinguish between vowels which were originally in 
closed syllables, e. g. OE. dseg day, helpan to help ; and 
those which were originally in open syllables, e. g. OE. 
dagas days, etan to eat. In the former case OE. se (a), o, e, 
usually appear in the W. dialect as a, o, e whereas in the 
latter case they have generally become ea, oi. ei. When 
through inflexional endings the vowels bb (a), o, e were in 
OE. now in a closed syllable, now in an open one, the W. 
dial, has mostly generalised the vowel of the open syllable. 



1. The Short Vowels.

§§ 64 7°J THE VOWELS TREATED HISTORICALLY. 3 1 

The regularly developed form oud to hold is now only used 
in the phrase oud on stop ! The usual form od to hold, is a 
new formation from the past participle odn, where the stem 
vowel has been regularly shortened before the following n. 

§ 65. ME. ai, ei from OE. aeg has become ea : 
brean orcein, dea day, deazi daisy, eal (OE. hsegl) hail, 
fean (OE. faBgen) glad, fain, gladly, fea(r) fair, mea 
(shortened in mebi perhaps, possibly) may, mean main, 
neel nail, peal pail, slea (a new formation from the past 
participle) to slay ; slean slain, sneal snail, teal tail. 

§ 66. a became lengthened to a before mb already in 
early ME., as is shown by the forms in the Ormulum. This 
a fell together with OE. a = Germanic ai, and has accord- 
ingly become ua (see § 122) in the Windhill dialect: 
kuam comb, wuarn womb, lam lamb is a new formation 
from the plural, where the short vowel was regularly 
retained, cp. Ormulum ace. sing, lamb (i. 274) beside ace. 
plural lammbre (ii. 109). The word-lists in vol. v of 
Ellis' Early English Pronunciation show that all English 
dialects have a short vowel in this word. 

§ 67. a has become ei in eit eight, eit' (with suspended 
t) eighth. In meits to measure the ei seems to point to an 
OE. 83 (cp. §§ 132, 138). 

§ 68. a has become ia in biad beard, gia(r) gear, iarin 
herring. 

§ 69. 83 (a) has become o in gas (OE. g83rs, ME. gers) 
grass ; and oi in loin (OE. lane ; lone) lane, which has had 
the same development as old o in open syllables. See § 109. 

§ 70. Short a in originally open syllables has usually 
become ea But see §71.

Weak Forms and Particles. 

§ 249. The following is a fairly complete list, arranged 
alphabetically, of words which have weak forms caused by 
the sentence accent. Any other unaccented forms not 
given here will be found under the headings of pronouns, 
auxiliary verbs, adverbs, conjunctions, and prepositions. 

The auxiliary verb diu is never used in asking questions, 
except when it begins the sentence: drje (deje) }>iiok il (el) 
diut ? do you think he will do it? but wile diut, J?ir>k je ? 
will he do it, do you think ? The auxiliary verb have (ev, 
e ; ev, e) is often omitted entirely, or perhaps rather has 
disappeared through assimilation ; thus a dunt I have done 
it, we funt we have found it ; here fun is the pp. and not 
the pret., ice found it is we fant. 

a = /. Chiefly used in direct assertions: a fan em /

vari very, viel veal, vois voice, voitSe(r) a large clothes*

tadz towards, § 243 ; as also in those compounded with 
worth: oepej? halfpenny worth, penef> pennyworth, siks-

§§ 252-256.] THE CONSONANTS. 79 



J. 
§ 252. OE. initial j, mostly written g, has had the same 
development as in lit. Engl. : ji, je ye, you, jie(r) year, jon 
yon, juek yoke, ju» young. 

§ 253. French u, which has become juw in lit. Engl., 
appears in the W. dial, as a falling diphthong initially, 
medially, and finally : ius use, iuneti unity, nuto(r) future, 
viu vieiu, § 237. 

The Liquids. 

1. 

§ 254. 1 has generally remained unchanged : lap to 
wrap up, lat late, lig to lie down, loin lane, Hum loom. 

boeld (ME. balled) bald, molt malt, fild field, mild mild, 
wild wild, bild to build, flik flitch of bacon, jole yellow, 
tselte(r) to clot, coagulate (of blood), twilt quilt, nozl to 
beat, thrash, blob bubble, galesez braces. 

dzoul to knock, strike, kal to frown, foel to fall, koil coal, 
teal tale, swiel £0 gutter (of a candle). 

§ 255. al has become 09 in the combinations If, OE. 
In, Ik, lm, 11, lv. For examples see §§ 62, 198. To these 
add : omest almost, oeminak almanac, oemend almond. 

al has become ou before a following d. For examples 
see §§ 64, 199. 

ol has become ou before a following consonant. For 
examples see §§ 103, 220. 

§ 256. 1 has also disappeared before a following con- 
sonant in : wits (OE. hwele) ivhich, sits (OE. swelc) such, 
buk bulk, stup (ME. stolpe) a %)ost. 

It has also disappeared in: wod, wed, -d (§ 397) would, 



80 THE CONSONANTS. [§§ 256-260. 

sud, sed, st(§ 391) should, sant shall not, s (§ 391) shall, 
wite ? (§ 397) ivilt thou? wient will not. 

In fout (ME. faute, Fr. fa,ute) fault, mat (cp. Lat. mutare) 
to moult, there probably never was an 1 in the dialect 
forms. 

§ 257. Consonantal 1, when it came to stand finally, 
has become vocalic after consonants : adl to earn, kitl to 
tickle, nibl to nibble, ridl sieve, satl to settle. For further 
examples see § 247 b. 

r. 

§ 258. r, which is a gently (not strongly as in Scotch) 
trilled sound, has only remained intact before a following 
vowel : 

raiv to tear, reit right, ram to thrust, press, rizd rancid 
(of bacon), bri» to bring, brek to break, beri to bury, fere 
furroiv, sore sorrow, sare to serve, vari very. 

r has probably been lost in aim (OE. hrim ?) hoarfrost. 

§ 259. Before a following consonant it has entirely 
disappeared : ban (§ 61) child, bied (§ 68) beard, wak (§ 74) 
work, bek (§ 90) birch, boen (§ 104, 1) born, bued (§ 104, 2) 
board, dest (§ 113, t) durst, bej) (§ 120, 1) fr£r£A, aien (§ 157) 
iron, dalin (§ 189) darling, kweet (§ 203) quart, savnt 
(§ 207) servant, oecSe(r) (§ 223) order, ken (§ 228) currant, 
faoe(r) father, pi. facSez, swie(r) to swear, but i swiez he 
swears. 

Note. — The above list contains one example only of the various vowels 
which have been influenced through the absorption of the r; for full lists 
of examples, see the paragraphs enclosed in parentheses. 

§ 260. r, which has come to stand finally in the 
modern dialect, is still slightly trilled, but not so strongly 
as before a following vowel. This is always the case when 



§§260-264.] THE CONSONANTS. 8 1 

the word containing it is used alone, or stands at the end 
of a sentence. In these positions it is never weakened into 
a mere voiced glide as in lit. Engl, fear, nor does it dis- 
appear altogether as in lit. Engl. far. We thus make a 
distinction between peo pay, and pee(r) pair, ka cotv, and 
kae(r) to cower. 

r disappears, of course, altogether in the sentence when 
the next word begins with a consonant: aje ban ? are you 
going ? wi wo leekin we were playing. 

Examples of final r are : wae(r) worse, dlue(r) to stare 
hard, smue(r) to smother, bie(r) to bear, pie(r) pear. 

§ 261. In addition to the examples in which r has 
undergone metathesis in the lit. language as, bed bird, ban 
to burn, brit bright, frit fright, 00s horse, J?§d third, we 
have brust to burst, gen to grin, gas (also OE. gsers) grass, 
gesl gristle, get great, kesmes Christmas, kesn to christen. 

§ 262. r has disappeared in pim-ruez primrose. 



The Nasals. 

m. 

§ 263. m has generally remained unchanged : muml 
to mumble, muin moon, mistl cow-house, mizl to drizzle (of

tremble, tseeme(r) chamber, tuml to tumble, uml humble. 

brim to put the boar to the soiv, gam to gamble, krum 
crumb, ram room, sam up to pick up. 

§ 264. m has become vocalic after consonants : bodm 
bottom, fadm fathom, film film, kindm kingdom, m is also 
vocalic in em ( = m) them.

gnaw, nibble, nati neat, tidy, dexterous (of old people), navi 
canal, nit night, nio(r) kidney, noilz (pi.) the short hairs 
taken out of wool by the combing machine.

lsenan) to lend, nuin noon, olin holly, speen (OE. spanan) 
to wean. 

§ 269. n has become vocalic after dentals and sibilants : 
eensn ancient, fesn fashion, fezn pheasant, frozn frozen, 
miln (OE. myln) mill, ratn (0. Fr. raton) rat, seldn (OE. 
seldon) seldom. For other examples see § 247 b. 

§ 270. n has become vocalic m after labials by assimi- 
lation : 

apm (lit. happen) perhaps, flpms fuvepence, J>repms three 
pence, etc., opm open, wiepm weapon. For further ex- 
amples see § 247 b. 

evm even, imin evening, sevm seven, uvm oven, wovm

§ 274. id has disappeared through assimilation before 
the following kn in the pp. of verbs ending in r>k : drukn 
drunk, drunken, suk» sunk, slukn slunk, srukn shrunk. 
But see § 368. 

§ 275. » has become n before the following dental in :

eaves of a building, midin (ME. midding) dunghill, runin 
running, and similarly in all present participles.

The Labials. 

P. 

§ 278. p has remained in all positions : 

pei pea, pimruez primrose, piek perch, pak a kind of \ 
blain, poem palm, poez (O. Fr. poulser) to kick, poutri 
poultry, prog to collect wood for the bonfire on the fifth of

§ 279. Assimilation has taken place as in lit. Engl, in 
emti (ME. empti, but OE. semet(t)ig) empty, kubed cup- 
board. 

b. 

§ 280. The voiced explosive b has generally remained 
in the W. dialect : 

ban child, bef (ME. beffin) to cough, bek beck, ber> (O. Icel. 
banga to hammer), to throw, hit violently, bid to invite to a 
funeral, boged ghost, brig bridge, bun bound. 

bleb blister, blut5e(r) to tveep, generally used in the phrase

body. 



§§282,283.] THE CONSONANTS. 85

lit. Engl. : oseml to assemble, fuml to fumble, muml to

tuml to tumble, piml thimble, uml humble. 

kakuma(r) cucumber, nume(r) number, slume(r) slumber, 
tseQme(r) chamber. 

f. 

§ 283. OE. f was used to re resent both the voiceless 
( = Mod. Engl, f ) and the voiced ( = Mod. Engl, v) spirant. 

1. Initially it was voiceless and corresponds to Ger- 
manic f. 

2. Medially it was voiced, except in the combinations ff. 
ft, fs. See Sievers, OE. Gr. § 192. 

3. Finally it was probably voiceless in the historic period 
even when it corresponded to Germanic B. But when OE. 
f came to stand medially through being followed by a case, 
or personal ending, etc., it was voiced, thus wif wife, gen. 
wifes, pret. sing, geaf /, he gave, pi. geafon. In this case 
the W. dial., like lit. Engl., has sometimes generalized the 
one form, sometimes the other. We shall here treat the 
sounds in the above order. 

1. faSe(r) father, feu feiv, flee to frighten, flumaks to 
confound, cheat, foil foal, foud fold, fouk folk, fout fault, 
freem to make a start, fudl to confuse, fuzi soft, si^ongy. 

2. eft haft, gift gift, rift to belch, eructate, sift to sift, 
weft weft, kuf cuff. 

delv to delve, daiv to dive, draiv to drive, duv dove, evm 
heaven, ivafr) ever, kav to carve, kuav cove, livo(r) liver, 
neiv (0. Icel. knefi) fist, nive(r) never, raiv (O. Icel. rifa to 
break) to tear, siv sieve, stav to starve, stuev stove, seav to 
shave, suv to shove, J?raiv to thrive, weiv to weave. 



86 THE CONSONANTS. [§§283-286. 

ev, ev, © have, and liv to live are, of course, not directly 
developed from OE. habban, libban but from the forms 
without gemination, as hafa'S he has, hsefde he had, liofatS 
he lives, lifde he lived. 

It has disappeared as in lit. Engl, in such words as : ez 
hast, has, elte(r) (OE. healfter) halter, enent opposite, ied 
head, kroal to crawl, oak hawk, leadi lady, load lord, wimin 
women, wumen woman. 

It has also disappeared in: ebun above, imin evening, 
steim (ME. stefnen, OE. ge-stefnian and a stemnian to give 
voice for, appoint) to bespeak a thing, sul shovel, gin given, 
oue(r) beside ove(r) over, nio(r) beside nivefr) never, and 
generally also in the present gi, pret. ga and e, 9 have, 
when the next word begins with a consonant. 

The voiced spirant has become b in rebit rivet, if the 
dial, word is etymologically the same as the lit. Engl. word. 

3. delf stone quarry, kaf chaff, oaf half, ruif roof, t§f 
turf, ]?if thief, uif hoof, waif wife, 

aiv hive, faiv five, greev grave, twelv Vwelve.

tame, temz (ME. temse) hop-sieve, teu (OE. teawian) to 
work zealously, toe a marble of any kind, toidi small, 
little, trolep a dirty, untidy person, tul (O. Icel. til) to. 

§ 286. Medial t has mostly remained unchanged : 



§§286-290.] THE CONSONANTS. 8j 

antra (OE. antefn) anthem, getn got, nati neat, tidy, dex- 
terous (of old people), ratn rat, tluste(r) cluster. 

It has become d in bodm bottom, praid pride. It has 
become r in poreets potatoes, has undergone metathesis in 
witek wicket, and disappeared before the b in nobed (lit. 
not but) only. 

§ 287. t is dropped between s and a following 1 or n in : 
busl bustle, bruslz bristles, gesl gristle, kasl castle, rasl 

to %vrestle, £>rosl thrush, wisl ivhistle, desnt durst not ; but 

mistl (0. Icel. mjalta-sel shed for milking) cow-house. 
brusn (pp) burst, fasn to fasten, lisn to listen, ouo-kesn 

overcast, gloomy (of the sky), J?rusn (pp.) thrust. 

ts > ss > s in wisnde Whitsuntide. Whitsunday is wisnde 

sunde. 

§ 288. The t in French words which has become ts in 
lit. Engl, through the influence of the following ii has 
remained in the W. dialect : 

fleto(r) feature, f enite(r) furniture, fiute(r) future, foetn 
fortune, kriete(r) creature, moiste(r) moisture, neete(r) 
nature, natrel natural, paste(r) pasture, pikte(r) picture, 
vente(r) to venture. 

§ 289. When t came to stand finally in the W. dial., or 
was final already in OE., it has generally remained : 

rift (OE. f if ta) fifth, sikst sixth, toist toast, twelft twelfth. 

bat without, feit to fight, get great, goit (ME. gote) water 
channel, mit to meet, out holt, slat to bedabble, suit soot. 

bit bit, fat fat, it it, kot staples of ivool tightly entangled 
together, lat (OE. Isett) lath, lat late, mat mat, net net, wet 
wet. 

§ 290. The t in all verbal forms ending in t preceded 
by a short vowel, appears as r when the next word begins 
with a vowel. We regularly say : amit im ivri dee I meet 



88 THE CONSONANTS. [§§290-297. 

him every day ; but amer im ivri dee i" met him every day. 
Similarly with get me wun get me one, ger up get up, gar 
got, ir to hit, ler to let, pur to put, sar sat, ser to set, sir to 
sit, sur to shut, etc. Also in all the present participles, as 
gerin getting. 

Note. — This phenomenon is widely spread in Mod. English dialects. See 
EEPr. vol. v. p. 420. 

The same is also the case with the pronoun wot ivhat : 
wotste dun ? ivhat hast thou done? but wor iz it ? ivhat is it? 

§ 291. t has become d in : abed yes but, bed but, prad 
proud, buzed (O. Fr. busart), butterfly, Adkisn Atkinson, 
warend to warrant. 

§ 292. It has been dropped in ken currant, sadzn 
sergeant, dzais (O. Fr. giste) joist. The older generation 
also say omes almost, avis harvest, bies (lit. beast) cow, 
coivs. 

§ 293. A t is never pronounced in eensn (Fr. ancien) 
ancient, fezn (O. Fr. faisan) pheasant, tairen tyrant. 

§ 294. t is excrescent in vament vermin. 

d. 

§ 295. Initial d has remained : daiv to dive, deu dew, 
di to die, died dead, dof to undress, don to dress, dreet to ' 
drawl. 

§ 296. Medial d has also generally remained un- 
changed : 

fidl fiddle, inde(r) to hinder, midin (ME. midding, Dan. 
mogdynge) dunghill, midl middle, nidi needle, ridn riden, 
wide widoiv, sadl saddle, redi ready. 

§ 297. Intervocalic d followed by r in the next syllable 



§§297-301.] THE CONSONANTS. 89 

has become S : ble<5o(r) bladder, blu(5e(r) to cry, weep, 
dic$0(r) (ME. diderin) to shiver, fatSe(r) father, focSe(r) fodder, 
get5e(r) to gather, te-getSa(r) together, itSa(r) hither, konsi<5o(r)

about a thing, mutSe(r) mother, pacSo(r) powder, su'Se(r) to 
shudder, tlutSe(r) to get closely together, uc5e(r) udder, 
voic5a(r) (O. Fr. voider to void) a large clothes basket, 
wecSa(r) weather. 

Note. — The words thither and whither are not used in the dialect. 

The law also holds good when an 1 or r has disappeared 
before the d: socSa(r) solder, m§cSe(r) murder, oecSe^r) to 
order. 

Note. — The S in ma'o'o(r) is probably not the p in OE. myrpran, but rp 
became rd (§ 306, 2) and then ft by the above law. 

§ 298. d never occurs between n — 1, n — r, as in lit. 
English : 

anl handle, dwinl to dwindle, kanl candle, kinlin fire- 
wood, spinl spindle. 

gano(r) gander, bun9(r) thunder. 

§ 299. d has disappeared in ansem handsome, anil 
handful, grunsil groundsel, gran-facSe(r), gram-fatS9(r) 
grandfather, lanloed landlord, unded hundred, but undat 
(by assimilation of dt) hundredth. 

§ 300. OE. final d and the medial d which has come 
to stand finally in the W. dial, have generally remained : 
bid to invite to a funercd, find to find, grund ground, od 
to hold, oud old, pund pound, roid a clearing (of a wood), 
sind to rinse, wash out, wund a wound, blier-id blear- 
eyed. 

§ 301. d has disappeared after n in : bran (OE. brand) 
niu quite new, en and, bazn thousand, uzbn husband, 



90 THE CONSONANTS. ['§§ 301-306. 

and also in the pret. and pp. of the verbs bind to bind, find 
to find, wind to wind, thus : ban, bun ; fan, fun ; wan, 
wun. 

d has also been dropped in skafl scaffold, skaflin 
scaffolding. 

§ 302. Final ndz has become nz : anz hands, frenz 
friends, senz sends, grunz (lit. grounds) sediment. J>azn 
and uzbn may accordingly be new formations from the 
plural forms. 

§ 303. A d is never pronounced in ain (ME. nine) 
hind, ban (0. Icel. buenn) going, as wie te ban ? where art 
thou going ?, len (OE. lsenan) to lend. 

§ 304. d is excrescent in arend (ME. aranie, 0. Fr. 
araigne) spider, drand to drown. 

§ 305. d has become t in wate (lit. work-day), week- 
day, wesit worsted, st the weak form of sud should. In 
b9-int behind, the t is probably due to the t in frunt front ; 
for similar examples see Paul-Braune's Beitrage, xiii. p. 590. 
In the phrase iust te wod or wed to be wont or willing, the t 
is due to assimilation with te : oa iust te wed diu e bit e 
wak thou wast formerly wont to do a bit of work. 

h 

§ 306. OE. p, also written tS, was a voiceless spirant 
like the th in lit. Engl, thin, initially, finally as also 
medially except probably between voiced sounds. Between 
voiced sounds it was probably voiced like the th in lit. 
Engl, breathe. See Sievers, OE. Gr. § 201. 

We shall here adopt the following order : 1. Initially. 
2. When the sound or its further development has remained 
medial in the W. dialect. 3. When it has become final in 



§3°6.] THE CONSONANTS. 9 1 

the W. dialect. In this case two subdivisions are neces- 
sary according as we have now the voiceless or the voiced 
sound. Cp. § 283, 3. 

Fifty years ago f for p and v for $ were quite general 
throughout the Township of Idle, but they have now prac- 
tically disappeared except as an individualism. When I 
was a boy p and cS were regularly used among the younger 
Windhill people, but f and v were still generally used in 
Thackley and Idle, which are only about a mile distant 
from W. I well remember how we used to twit the 
Thackley and Idle people about their pronunciation of 
these sounds : fakle Thackley, fink think, fid third, leev 
barn, smivi smithy, etc. 

1. p has remained voiceless except in pronouns and the 
adverbs derived from them : 

}>ak thatch, J?ir>k to think, J>oil to give ungrudgingly, 
J?raiv to thrive, J>riep (OE. ]?reapian to rebuke) to contradict, 
dispute. 

In the pronouns and the adverbs derived from them 
there originally existed double forms : the stressed forms 
with p and the unstressed forms with S. The W. dial., like 
lit. Engl., has generalised the latter, which are now used 
both as the stressed and unstressed forms. See the Chapter 
on the pronouns : 

tSa thou, Si thy, Sat (only as demonstrative, the rel. pr. 
and cj. is et which is of Norse origin) that, Sem (mostly 
as demonstrative, the pers. pr. is em) those, Sis this, etc. ; 
Sie(r) there, Sen then, etc. 

The def. art. is generally t and is attached to the following 
word, thus tman the man, toudn the old one, tkoilz the 
coals. We make a clear distinction between teebl table 
and t'teebl the table, eit eight and eit' eighth, the former is 
the ordinary Engl, t and the latter is a suspended t. S has 



92 THE CONSONANTS. [§§ 306-309. 

become t in the nom. of the second pers. sing, of the pers. 
pronoun when used interrogatively and in subordinate 
sentences (§ 350) : es-te ? hast thou ? sal-te ? shalt thou ? wi- 
te ? wilt thou ? kante diut ? canst thou do it ? J?a kr> gue 
wen tot redi thou canst go tvhen thou art ready. 

p has disappeared before w in : wak to beat severely, see 
Skeat, Et. Diet., witl (ME. J>witel) large carving knife, 
weo (OE. J>wang) thong. 

Occasionally the p is omitted in the pres. tense of J>mk, 
as a i-ok I think. 

2. Between vowels we have S : fe<5e(r) feather, lac5e(r) 
foam, froth, le$e(r) leather, ree"Se(r) rather, smiSi smithy, 
wetSe(r) (OE. wecSer) the wool of a sheep which has already 
been shorn at least once before. 

It has become d medially after r in : bedn burden, fadin 
farthing, efued to afford. 

It has also become d in : fadm fathom, snodn to make 
smooth, snod (O. Icel. snooenn smooth (of hair), bald) 
smooth, even. 

t5 has disappeared in moek (0. Icel. matSkr) maggot, and

Sibilants. 

S. 

§ 310. Initially and finally as also medially (except 
between voiced sounds) OE. s was a voiceless spirant like 
the s in Mod. English sin. Medially between voiced 
sounds it was possibly voiced like the s in Mod. English 
rise. See Sievers, OE. Gr. § 204. 

The development of s in the W. dialect is parallel with 
that of f (§ 283) and p (§ 306), so that we shall here 
distinguish the three positions : 1. Initially. 1. When 
the sound has remained medial in the W. dialect. 3. When 
the sound was already final in OE. or has become final in 
the W. dialect. Here two subdivisions are necessary 
according as we have now the voiceless or the voiced 
spirant. Cp. § 283. 

1. Initial s has remained both before vowels and con- 
sonants : sa a drain, sough, sak to suck, sam up to pick up, 
seem lard, set to set, si (OE. seon = OHG. slhan) to stretch, 
sin since, sind to rinse, wash out, slate'r) to spill, smuiS 
smooth, snod smooth, even, snikit a small 2^ssage, speik to 
speak, spitek spigot, steim to bespeak, stedi steady, strie 
strata, swaf> the skin of bacon, sweep the handle of a 
machine. 

s (?) has become s in su, se she. 

s has also remained before u in French words, whereas in 
the lit. language it has become s : siuge'r) sugar, siue(r) 
sure. 



94 THE CONSONANTS. C§§ 310, 311. 

2. Medially between voiced sounds we have z : bizm 
besom, biznas business, buzed butterfly, dlazn to glaze, fezn 
pheasant, frozn frozen, fuzi soft, spongy, mizl to drizzle (of 
rain), rizd rancid (of bacon), rizn risen, jpazn thousand, 
uzbn husband, wizn to wither. 

z has also remained before ii in French words, but has 
become z in the lit. language: meze(r) measure, pleze'r) 
pleasure, treze(r) treasure. 

The S in sitSaz scissors is difficult to explain. It is just 
possible that it may have been influenced by saitS scythe, 
just as mud might (verb) has probably been influenced by 
kud could, sud should, and be-int behind by frunt front, 
and beed to bathe by weed to wade. 

In combination with voiceless sounds s has been retained : 
besk to bask, blosm blossom, fasn to fasten, kist a chest, 
kesn to christen, musl muscle, rasl to wrestle, rust (O.Icel. 
rost) rest, repose, trast to trust, J>rosl (OE. Jrostle) thrush. 

3. as house, dlas glass, dzais (O.Fr. giste) joist, gis #eese, 
kes to curse, kus Hss, las (pi. lais) louse, mas (pi. mais) 
mouse, muns months, oes horse, ues(t) hoarse, tSis £to.

thou? greoz £0 graze, iuz to use, loiz (OE. losian) to lose,

Final z is very common in originally unstressed forms, 
as iz, z is, tSaz £Aou /*<xs£, iz he has, he is, ez, uz us, never us 
even as stressed form, oz as. 

§ 311. s has disappeared in: pei (ME. pese) pea, ridl

cherry.

The Gutturals. 

C. 

§ 312. Germanic k, generally written c in OE., re- 
mained a guttural initially before the guttural vowels a, a, 
o, 6, u, u and their mutations e, se, e, e (ce), y, y, but became 
a palatal before the palatal vowels se, se ( = OHG. a), e 
( = Germanic e) ea, eo, ea, eo, i, I and their mutations e, ie 
(=i-umlaut of ea 5 eo), ie (i-umlaut of ea, eo). 

Medial c and cc remained a guttural before a following 
a, o, u, but became palatal when an i or j originally 
followed, as sec(e)an = Goth. sokjan to seek, )?ecc(e)an from 
older *J>akjan to cover, bryce from older *brukiz breach. 
See Sievers, OE. Gr. §§ 206-7. 

But already at an early period the palatals became 
gutturals again in many cases in the Anglian dialects, e. g. 
secan to seek, J>encan to think, cald cold. See Sweet, HES. 
§ 535, Kluge, Grundriss der germanischen Philologie, i. pp.

§ 314. The relation, if any, of bleg, plural blegz, to 
blackberry is difficult to explain. It may be that blakberi 
became blagberi by assimilation, and that then beri was 
dropped, blag would regularly become bleg in the W. 
dial., see § 59. 



g- 

§ 315. OE. initial g was a voiced spirant before both 
vowels and consonants. Before guttural vowels and their 
mutations (cp. § 312) it was a guttural spirant, as also 
before se (Sievers, OE. Gr. § 212), but before the palatal 
vowels e ( = Germanic e), ea, eo, ea, eo, i, ie it was a palatal 
spirant. At a later period the guttural spirant became an 
explosive before consonants, guttural vowels, and y ( = i- 
umlaut of u), e ( — i-umlaut of 6) ; but the palatal spirant 
remained. On forms like Mod. Engl, give, get, begin, etc., 
see Sweet's New English Grammar §§ 817-8, and Kluge in 
Paul's Grundriss I. pp. 843-4. 

Medially between vowels it was a voiced spirant. After 
n (=») it was an explosive. And when geminated 
(written eg) it was also a voiced guttural or palatal ex- 
plosive according as it was originally followed by a guttural 
or palatal vowel. 

During the OE. period final g became h after long guttural 
vowels and r, 1, Sievers § 214. 

1 . Initial g before consonants. 

It has disappeared before n : neeg to gnatv, nat gnat.

addressing children only, just as doi still is, and then after- 
wards have become used for grown-up persons. 

ts. 

§ 330. We regularly have ts in the same words in 
which the literary language has it: tsapl chapel, tseedz 
to charge, tse9me(r) chamber, tsari cherry, tsimli chimney, 
tsois choice, tsons chance, tsont chant. 
preits to preach, pouts to poach.

CHAPTER VII. 

NOUNS. 

A. Formation of the Plural. 

I. Plurals in -©z, -z, -s. 

§ 331. Nouns ending in s, s, z, z add ez to form the 
plural, as las lass lasez, fees face feesez, but as 
house has azez ; dis dish disez, wots ivatch wotsez ; nuez 
nose, nuezez, saiz size saizez ; edz hedge edzez, dzudz 
judge dzudzez. 

§ 332. Nouns ending in a vowel or voiced consonant 
other than z, z add z, as : lad lad ladz, gam game gamz, 
ratn rat ratnz, leeS barn leeoz, dee day deez. But nouns 
ending in -nd, (-r) lose the -d, (-r) before the plural ending 
§§ 302, 259, as frend friend frenz, fafio(r) father fatSez. 

§ 333. Nouns ending in a voiceless consonant other 
than s, s add s, as lat lath lats, kap caj) kaps, die]? death 
diej?s, maj? mouth ma]?s, waf wharf wafs, ruif roof ruifs. 



108 NOUNS. L§§ 333-337- 

But nouns ending in f preceded by a vowel or diphthong 
(except ui) which was long in OE., and nouns originally 
ending in -If change the f into v and add z in the plural, as 
luef loaf luevz, naif knife naivz, koef calf koevz. 

2. Plurals in -n. 

§ 334. There are only three nouns which have -n in 
the plural : I eye in, oks ox oksn, su shoe suin. 

3. Plural in -r. 

§ 335. The only example of this class is tsilde(r) 
children. In the singular we use ban, the plural of which 
is banz, and is in more general use than tsilde(r). 

4. Plurals with umlaut. 

§ 336. These are : fuit foot fit. guis goose gis, las louse 
lais, man man men, mas mouse mais, tuij? tooth tij?, wumen 
woman wimin. 

5. Singular and Plural alike. 

§ 337. as ash, ashes, Us fish, fishes, sip sheep. 
Nouns expressing time, space, weight, measure, and 
number, when preceded by a cardinal numeral, as iz net 
bin sin fe ten jie(r) he has not been seen for ten years, but 
its jiez sin e we sin it's years since he was seen, and 
similarly with munj> month, wik week. J>ri mail J>re 
Koevle three miles from Calverley, but mailz J>re tSie(r) miles 
from there, and similarly for ins inch, fuit foot, jied yard, 
eeke(r) acre, etc. ten pund 9 meit ten pounds of meat, cp. 
lit. Engl, a ten-pound note, but tSe we punz ont weested 
there %vere pounds of it wasted, and similarly with ans 
ounce, stuen stone, unded weit hundred weight, etc. tu 
kweet et best two quarts of the best {ale), siks gain six 
gallons, nain silin nine shillings, etc. foue skue(r) four 
scores, but skuez on em scores of them, etc. 



§§338.339-1 NOUNS. 109 

6. Miscellaneous. 

§ 338. Some nouns are only used in the plural as: 
kruds curds, laps a kind of woollen waste mode in 
spinning, lits lungs of animals, loks small pieces of wool 
which have been detached from the fleece, mezlz measles, 
noilz the short hairs taken out of the wool by the combing 
machine, roidz clearings (of a vjood), now only used in the 
phrase West Eoidz West Royds, siSez scissors, sparinz banns 
of marriage, tenz tongs, truzaz trousers. Others have a 
different meaning in the singular and the plural, as brig 
bridge pi. brigs bridges, a trivet to put across a tub to 
support the hop-sieve, green grain greenz malt which has 
been used in brewing beer, grund ground grunz sediment. 

Nouns with double plural endings are rare, but we have 
them in : belasaz bellows, galesaz braces, stepsez steps. 

In speaking of cows the form bies is generally used, as a 
moni bias eje na? hoiv many coivs (lit. beasts) have you 
now ? 

poridz porridge, always, and broj? broth, frequently, 
require the plural form of the verb as Sem poridz worent 
ez guid ez cSa out ta (a) bin, lit. them porridge were not as 
good as they ought to have been. 



B. Formation of the Genitive Case. 

§ 339. The sign of the genitive both singular and 
plural is generally omitted when one noun qualifies another ; 
the two nouns thus forming a kind of compound, as "Semz 
mi faSe buits those are my father's boots ; but Sera buits e 
mi fatSaz those boots are my father s, tlad fafte buits the boy's 
father's boots, but tbuits e tlad faSez the boots of the boy's 



IIO NOUNS. [§339. 

father, 8em banz (never banzez) mu$8(r) those children s 
mother. 

When the genitive is not followed by another noun, the 
gen. singular and plural have the same form as the nom. 
plural. The only exceptions are that nouns which end in 
-vz in the plural have -fs in the gen. singular, waifs tuife's, 
and the two umlaut-plurals men, wimin have sing, manz, 
wumenz, plural menz, wiminz. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

ADJECTIVES. 

1. The Articles. 

§ 340. The indefinite article e a, en an, differs from 
lit. Engl, in so far that e may be used before both vowels 
and consonants. It is equally right to say : av etn e or en 
apl / have eaten an apple. In nidiet idiot and noreisn 
row, disturbance, the initial n has come from the inclef. 
article, Sis nidiet this idiot, wots tmienin e els noreisn? 
what is the meaning of this (lit. oration) row? Cp. lit. 
Engl, newt for ewt. Observe the phrase : a wer i sits en e 
steet I was in such (an) a state. 

§ 341. The definite article t the is generally attached to 
the following word, as tman the man, tkoilz the coals, tak 
tguid enz take the good ones, tloed e tmane(r) the lord of 
the manor, a duent noe wot tman did wit / don't know 
what the man did with it, a no(e) ue tman wo(r) / know 
who the man was. 

When the word following the definite article begins with 
t or d, the only trace of the article is that t and d become 
suspended or popularly expressed lengthened. We make a 
clear distinction between teebl table and t'eebl the table, 
dlium gloom and d'lium the gloom. 



I 1 2 ADJECTIVES. [§§ 341, 342. 

Cp. the similar distinction between eit eight, and eit' 
eighth. 

We however always use tSe before loed when it means 
God, as <Sez nuebdi bad cSe loed en mi, noez wot iv ed te 
baid there is nobody but the Lord and myself, know what I 
have had to suffer. So (never t) is also used after ue ivho, 
wot ivhat, in such expressions as : ue 8e divl did (Sat ? who 
the devil did that ? wot $e enment duz e wont ? what the 
hangment does he want ? a duent noe wot tSo eminent i did 
wit i" don't Jcnoiv what the hangment he did with it. 

Note. — In order to obtain information on this difference in the use of t and 
tJa in some other Yorkshire dialect, I wrote to Mr. Bradley, the Joint 
Editor of the New English Dictionary, who is thoroughly conversant with 
the Sheffield dialect ; and from his kind communication I learn that the 
distinction in the Sheffield dialect is practically the same as in my own. 
I venture to quote the following extract from his letter, which will be 
found interesting and instructive. — 't' lord o' t' manor — (decidedly). 
When " Lord " means God, the association of liturgical and Bible reading 
generally cause the full pronunciation (fia) to be used. But I have, 
though rarely, heard t' Lord, in rather off-hand, irreverent speech ; and 
"Lord knows" without any article at all is common enough. A don't 
know what t'man did wi' it — (certainly not "Ba man, nor man without 
article). What the hangment, What the devil, What the plague, etc. — 
(always "Ka, never t or omitted). A know who t' man wor — (certainly 
nottJa, nor omitted).' 



2. Comparison of Adjectives. 

§ 342. The comparative is formed by adding -e(r) and 
the superlative by adding -ist to the positive. This rule 
also holds good for familiar adjectives of two or more 
syllables. But unfamiliar adjectives of more than one 
syllable sometimes form the comparative and superlative 
by prefixing mue(r), muest. 

fae(r) far, fare(r), farist ; jun young, jur>e(r), jumst or 
jurist ; uelsm wholesome, uelsm-e(r), uelsm-ist ; biutifl 
beautiful, biutifl-er, biutifl-ist.

§ 345. The old form uen one is still retained in the 
phrase tuen the one of two, as tuen on em est, lit. the one of 
them has it, i. e. one of the tivo has it. The unaccented form 
is en or rather vocalic n, as it wer e guidn it was a good 
one. We may also note wun-a somehow, wun-a er enu<Se(r) 
somehow or other. 

On the suspended t' in eit' eighth, see §§ 341, 306. 

m for older n (§ 270) is regularly heard in sevm, (a)levm ; 
but in sevnt, (e)levnt, sevntin, etc., m for older n is seldom, 
if ever, heard. 

All the ordinals, except seknd and J>9d, end in t. Most 
of these are, of course, new formations made after the 
analogy of f est, flft, sikst, twelft which had t in OE. See 
§ 309. In a similar manner the lit. Engl, ordinals fifth, 



§§ 345-349-] ADJECTIVES. I 1 5 

sixth, tivelfth, and all those ending in -nth are new forma- 
tions made after the analogy of such forms as fourth, OE. 
feowercSa. 

§ 346. In playing at games, e.g. marbles toaz, boys 
have the following ordinals, denoting the order in which 
each is to begin the game. The boy who calls out fori has 
the first turn. The order is fori first, seki second, bgdi 
third, lari last. 

Note. — toa is used for a marble of any kind. When made of marble or 
alabaster it is called a wait ali, if streaked with red veins a bluid ali ; 
when of glass a glas ali ; when made of powdered stone a stuani ; when 
made of clay a pot donak.

The weak forms are in parentheses. They are far more 
frequently employed than the strong ones ; the latter are 
only used to express special emphasis. 

The weak form i / is older than a, it arose from the 
shortening of 1 before the latter became ai, whereas a is the 
regular weak form of ai, cp. the weak forms abod yes but, 
wol until, wa why, beside the strong forms aibed. wail 
(noun) while, wai. Examples of the first person are : 

muni gue wi je ? must I go ivith you ? sali et temoen? shall 
I have it to-morrow? if id nobed e bit 9 bras, a wodnt 
(or ad net) diu sits wak if I had only a little brass 
(money), I ivould not do such work, al kum on si je, wen i

wol wa kum they will stop until {while) ive come, lets as 
im let us or me ask him, se J>enkt ez fa tpeanz wid tean 
wit she thanked us for the pains we had taken with it. The 
z in the strong form uz is never voiceless as it is in lit. 
Engl. The weak form s is only used when it is attached 
enclitically to a preceding voiceless consonant. 

The strong form ta and the weak forms ta, ta can only 
be used interrogatively and in subordinate sentences, as 
wil ta wes it? wilt thou ivash it? wita len met? wilt thou 
lend me it ? wies te kum J?riu ? (lit. ivhere hast thou come 
through) ivhere do you come from ? kan te diut bi <5isen ?

I l8 PEONOUNS. [§35°. 

as thou wast, Sal (never tal or tel) find im et iz wak thou 
wilt find him at his work. At first sight one might be 
inclined to assume that the forms ta, te have arisen from 
assimilation with verbal forms ending in -t, e. g. at (§ 396) 
art, out (§394) oughtest, dest (frequently des § 390) durst ; 
but these are the three solitary instances in which the 
second person singular ends in -t where assimilation could 
take place. See the personal endings (§ 385). It is far more 
probable that the forms have arisen from their unaccented 
position in the sentence. If this is right then the def. art. 
t has a similar origin. However the t of the article arose, 
I certainly do not believe that it is a clipped form of Sat 
that, which is regularly used as a demonstrative (§ 354), but 
never as a rel. pronoun or conjunction ; the latter are 
expressed by et (§§ 356, 401). am ban to tak tSe wi ma 
/ am going to take thee ivith me. ji or jo sed ot im it rew 
you said that I am in the wrong, wot did jo see tul im? 
ivhat did you say to him ? wil je sam mo tSem tluoz up ? 
will you pick up those clothes for me? jov etn ool tmeit suo 
jol e to diu bat na wol setedo you have eaten all the meat 
so you will have to do without until Saturday, if jo (not ji) 
si mi fa<Se(r), as im to kum uom if you see my father, ask 
him to come home, wi soo jo i tmiln ive saw you in the mill. 
The old objective form of the second person plural has 
entirely died out ; cp. on the other hand the disappearance 
in Modern English of the old nom. ye except in liturgical 
and the higher literary language. The pronoun of the 
second person singular is still extensively used, but it is 
not so general now as it was twenty years ago. When I 
was a lad the following was the rule : tSa was used in every 
case except that ji was used (1) in addressing strangers, 
especially grown-up people, or as a mark of respect to 
masters and old people; (2) children in addressing their 



§35°-] PRONOUNS, II9 

parents ; (3) people who had made each other's acquaintance 
after they had grown up usually employed ji in speaking 
to each other. 

The masc. of the third person singular is the only pronoun 
which has not at least two forms for the obj. case, im is no 
doubt used as a weak form so as to prevent confusion with 
the obj. case of the plural, t is attached to the preceding 
word. The nominative of the feminine presents great 
difficulties. Dr. Sweet in his New English Grammar 
(§ 1068) gives the following explanation for the lit. Engl, 
form she : the old demonstrative seo became shd through 
the intermediate stage seo(sjoo), then shd became con- 
taminated with the old personal pronoun heo, which gave 
rise to the form sheo which would regularly become she in 
Mod. English. This explanation may or may not be right 
for the lit. language, but a form sheo could not possibly 
become su, but only si in the W. dial, as also in the other 
dialects round about Windhill ; cp. the Dialect Tests in 
Ellis, EEPr. v. On the other hand, the uncontaminated 
form sho would not become su but siu in the modern 
dialect, cp. tiu too, diu do, etc. § 164 c ; unless we may 
assume, which I do not believe is the case, that the one 
solitary example (su shoe, but pi. suin §§ 163-4 c) con- 
taining u from older 6 has not been borrowed from the lit. 
language. On the various origins of W. u see § 40. For 
the present the form su she still remains a riddle. The 
strong form o*em is from OE. Seem (Sam), the dat. plural of 
the demonstrative pronoun se, seo, Sset, whereas the weak 
forms em, m are from OE. heom, the dat. plural of the 
personal pronoun he, hec, hit. 

Examples of the third person are: iz bin on trant oel 
twik he has been on the spree all the iveek, eze fotst Sat flik 
e beekr> ? has he fetched that flitch of bacon? i ied it wen 9

Sa kum reit uam they will soon be here if they come straight 
(right) home, al sel jam / will sell you them, kan je diu 
bat am ? can you do without them ? 

It is hardly possible to give a very clearly denned and 
accurate rule for the use of the weak nominative forms : 

a, wi ; ji ; i ; Su ; Se beside 
i, we ; je ; a ; se ; Se. 

The former set is mostly used in making direct assertions, 
and the latter in interrogative and subordinate sentences. 
i I and e he are never used in making direct assertions, but 
the other pairs are, and when the one form and when the 
other is used, seems to depend upon sentence rhythm. 

The obj. case of all persons is often used reflexively, as 
al wes me na I will wash myself now, am dzust ban te don 
me / am just going to dress myself, i lead im dan i tf lid 
he lay doivn in the field, kum fored lad en sit Se dan an al 
set tketl on come forward lad and sit (thee) down and I 
will set the kettle on (and make some tea). 

We always use the obj. case where in refined lit. Engl, 
the nom. is used : 

i. After the substantive verb, as its mi, J>i, e(r), im, uz, 
ji, Sem, lit. it is me, thee, her, him, us, you, them. Note 
Semz em et i want those are the ones that I ivant.

went he and I went, Bil en imz guen dan trued Bill and 
he have gone doivn the road, uz en tSem we tegecSer oel d'ee

3. When the subject of the principal sentence is sepa- 
rated from the predicate by a subordinate sentence, as : im 
et did Sat out te en he who did that ought to be hanged,

quently used than the strong ones, mi, "Si, cSe(r) are from 
the Middle English weak forms mi, tSi, oer, and not Modern

C§ 353- 



The stress is always on the second syllable. When 
these pronouns are used emphatically the stress on the 
second syllable is of course stronger than when they are 
used reflexively. All the forms -sel, -seln, -sen are often 
heard without any distinction in meaning. 



§353-1 PRONOUNS. 123 

Such a variety of forms must be quite modern, and is 
probably due to importation from neighbouring dialects. 
The -sen-forms are far more common than either of the 
other two. In the Eastern North Midland dialects, to 
which Windhill belongs (Ellis, EEPr. v. pp. 364-408). I find 
the following forms : -seln at Huddersfield and Halifax ; 
-sen at Bradford, Leeds, Dewsbury, Rotherham, Sheffield, 
Wakefield. In this division of dialects no -self-forms seem 
to be known. 

In order to find out the areas of the -sel, -seln, and -sen- 
forms I have carefully examined all the classified word- 
lists and comparative dialect specimens in Ellis, EEPr. 
v, with the following results, -sel is the only form that 
occurs in all the North Northern, West Northern, and 
East Northern dialects, except at Holderness (S.E. York- 
shire) and South Ainsty, where we find -sen. The North 
North Midland, West North Midland, and South North 
Midland dialects have only -sel. The Border Midland 
dialects, which embrace the county of Lincolnshire, have 
only the -sen-form. The -sen-form does not seem to occur 
south of Lincolnshire, -self is regularly found without 
exception in all the Eastern dialects. The Mid Southern 
dialects have -self, -zelf, except at Much Cowarne (nine miles 
N.E. of Hereford) we find -sel and in Western Dorset -zel. 
The North Border Southern, Mid Border Southern, and 
South Border Southern dialects have only -self. In the 
East Southern dialects, which embrace almost the whole 
of Kent, with East Sussex, examples are wanting except that 
-saaf, pi. -saavz occurs at Faversham (eight miles W.N.W. 
of Canterbury). The Northern West Southern dialects 
regularly have -zel. In the Southern West Southern dia- 
lects all three forms, -sel, -zel, and -self, occur. For the 
Western West Southern dialects examples are wanting.

The South Western dialects seem to have -self, but more 
examples are wanting to be certain, as only one example 
of the reflexive occurs in this division, viz. at Docklow 
(five miles E. S. E. of Leominster). For the North Western 
dialects there is only one example given in Ellis, viz. -sel 
for Pulverbach (seven miles S.W. of Shrewsbury). 

wesen, etc. have been formed from the weak possessive 
we(r) our, which is itself a .new formation, § 351. There 
is no difference in meaning or usage between wesen and 
wesenz, Sesen and desenz. jesen is used for the sing, and 
plural yourself, yourselves, but jesenz yourselves has always 
a plural meaning. 

The simplex self occurs in the dialect, as e tself seem 
dee on the self same day. 



4. Demonstrative.

et is of Norse origin and was originally only used as a 
conjunction with the meaning of that. But already in Old 
Icelandic it came to be used both as a relative pronoun and 
conjunction just as it still is in the W. dialect: a 110(0) et 
im i tgeot / know that I ami in the way. See Noreen, 
Altislandische und altnordische Grammatik, § 40a. et oc-

CHAPTER X. 

VERBS. 

§ 358. The verbs are divided into two great classes : — 
Strong and Weak — according to the formation of the pre- 
terite and past participle. Besides these two great classes 
of strong and weak verbs, there are a few others which 
will be treated under the general heading of Minor 
Groups. 

§ 359. The strong verbs form their preterite by means 
of ablaut. In order to facilitate the use of the book for 
philologists I have sub-divided them into seven classes and 
have adopted the order given in Sievers' Old English 
Grammar, §§ 382-97. 

A great many verbs which were strong in OE. are now 
weak in the dialect ; on the other hand a few, which were 
originally weak, have become strong. The lists contain all 
the strong verbs in general use. When two forms of the 
preterite and past participle are in existence, the less usual 
one is enclosed in brackets. Some verbs, which now 
usually have a weak preterite, still retain the old strong 
past participle, e.g. feseen forsaken, fretn beside frietad 
fretted, mourned. 

There is only one form for the singular and plural of 
the preterite just as in lit. Engl. The present and 



§§ 359-361.] 



VERBS. 



129 



the past participle of all classes have, as a rule, been regu- 
larly developed from their corresponding OE. forms. But 
the preterite of some classes, e. g. the whole of the first and 
second, are new formations made after the analogy of the 
pret. of the fourth and partly the fifth classes. Some few 
verbs have passed over from one class into another. All 
these points will be discussed in their proper places. 

§ 360. The preterite and the past participle of weak 
verbs end in -ed, -d, -t. See §§ 380-3. Many verbs, originally 
weak, have both a strong and a weak past participle. 
See §§ 380-3.

§ 362. The pret. of all verbs of this class is a new 
formation. The ee can arise neither from the OE. singular 
nor plural form. From the former we should have had 
ue (§ 122) and from the latter i (§ 89). The only classes 
of verbs which regularly have ee in the pret. are the fourth 
(§ 37 '*) an d part of the fifth (§ 372). To merely say that 
the pret. of Class I has been formed after the analogy of 
Class IV and part of Class V would be avoiding the real 
difficulty, which consists in giving a satisfactory reason 
why they should have had such an influence, seeing that 
they had no forms in common with Class I in OE. One 
might perhaps be inclined to think that the identity of the 
vowel in a pp. like ^ifenn given (Ormulum, i. 7 1 ) with that 
in a pp. like risenn risen (Ormulum, ii. 47) may have 
given rise to the new formation. But that would not do. 
In the dialect the pret. of gi(v) is ga(v) = Ormulum ^aff, 
gaff, ii. 16 At present I cannot even suggest a satisfactory 
explanation. 

§ 363. The pp. of sain is always weak, and I have 
also occasionally heard a weak pret. saind. For the pret. 
of straik I have often heard striuk, strak, the latter of 
which seems to be a shortening of the Northern ME. form 
strak ; the pp. of this verb corresponds to the early Mod. 
Engl. lit. form struken. 

§ 364. aid (OE. hydan) and daiv (OE. dyfan) were 
weak in OE. raiv (0. Icel. rifa) and J>raiv (0. Icel. p>rifa) 
are of Norse origin, straiv (0. Fr. estriver) was already 
strong in ME. kontraiv must be a late borrowing from 



§§ 364-367.]

§ 366. All the other verbs, which formerly belonged 
to this class, have become weak. 

OE. ceosan would regularly have become *tsiz (§ 187) in 
the dialect, tsiuz seems to be an early borrowing of the 
ME. West Midland form chiisen, which would regularly 
become tsiuz in the dialect. 

The ea in the pret. is not regularly developed from OE. 
ea, which has become io (§ 179), but is due to the analogy 
of such verbs as weev wove, need kneaded. Just as we 
have the pp. wovm, nodn, pret. weev, need, so to the pp. 
frozn, tlovm, tsozn there has been formed a new preterite 
freez, tleev, tseez.

§ 368. On the present form run, see Sweet NE. Gr. 
§ 1382. The pret. and pp. ban, fan, wan and bun, fun, 
wun are very widely spread in the Midland and Northern 
dialects, see the Word-lists in Ellis, EEPr. v. The pret. 
bren and pp. brun are no doubt new formations after the 
analogy of forms like sen, sun ; the weak pret. and pp. 
brout is also much used, but is not so common as the 
strong forms, in (ME. hengen, 0. Icel. hengja) and rin (OE. 
(h)ringan) were originally weak verbs, din (0. Icel. dengja), 
flin (O.Icel. flengja),slin (O.Icel. slongva) are of Norse origin, 
strin seems to be quite a modern formation from the noun. 
The pp. of verbs whose stem ends in nk regularly lose 
the medial guttural n in the W. dialect. I have assumed 
in the Phonology (§ 274) that n has disappeared through as- 
similation before the following kn in the pp. of these verbs. 
This is possible and not at all improbable ; but we must 
not exclude the possibility that some of these pp. may be 



134 VERBS. [§3 68 - 

of Norse origin, e.g. drukw (0. Icel. drukkenn), sukn 
(0. Icel. sokkenn), and that the remaining »k- verbs may 
have followed the analogy of these. This is a point well 
worth investigating, but of the five verbs ending in -r>k in 
the present and preterite, Ellis has unfortunately only the 
pp. of drink, and I have accordingly read through all his 
Word -lists, Dialect tests, and Comparative Specimens to see 
how far the form without medial k> in the pp. extends. 
The following is the result : The medial » is retained in 
all the Eastern, Western, and Southern dialects, with 
the exception of South Devon (Ellis, p. 163), which is 
probably a mistake on the part of Dr. Ellis' informant. 
All the Border Midland, Southern, North Midland, Western 
Mid Midland, Eastern Mid Midland, East Mid Midland, 
Western South Midland, Eastern South Midland, Northern 
North Midland, and Western North Midland dialects have 
medial id except at Colne Valley and at Burnley, where 
double forms — without and with medial » — seem to occur 
(pp. 334 and 351). In the Eastern North Midland division 
to which my own dialect belongs the form without medial 
» is found at Huddersfield, Halifax, Dewsbury which have 
drufen, at Keighley, Bradford, Leeds, Rotherham, Elland, 
and Calverley where the nasal has disappeared before the 
following k ; but medial k> occurs at Barnsley, Sheffield, and 
Marsden (seven miles S. W. of Huddersfield). In the East 
Northern division, Mid Yorkshire, North Mid Yorkshire, 
New Malton, Lower Nidderdale, Washam River district, 
South Cleveland, North East Coast, Danby and Skelton 
in Cleveland, and Whitby, all have the form without medial 
k>, but Market Weighton, Holderness, Malton, Pickering, 
and The Moors, Sutton and Goole retain the medial 
guttural nasal. All the West Northern dialects — for which 
there are a great number of examples in Ellis — lose the 



§§ 368, 369J 



VERBS. 



*35 



medial » except at Upper Swaledale. The same is also the 
case for the North Northern dialects, except that at New- 
castle-on-Tyne the medial e> seems to exist (Ellis, p. 647). 
For the Lowland division of English dialect districts in 
Scotland only forms without medial » are registered. It 
is however important to note that Dr. Murray, The Dialect 
of the Southern Counties of Scotland, has pp. drunk beside 
drukken, and only slunk, stunk, sunk, schrunk (serynkit). 
This would certainly seem to favour the idea that our 
drukn is of Norse origin, and that the pp. of the four other 
verbs have been formed after the analogy of it. 

In feet fought the vowel of the singular seems to have 
been carried over to the plural at an early period. The 
latter form then became generalized. The short o in the 
pp. is quite regular (§ 100). 

On the forms brust, brast, brusn see Sweet, NE. Gr. 
§ 1354, and on J>rust (ME. J?rusten, frusten, O. Icel. J?rysta) 
see loc. cit. § 1348.

Similarly swie(r) (OE. swerian, pret. sing, swor) has 
passed over from the sixth class into this. 

The ee in the preterite is due to levelling. The vowel of 
the pret. singular of strong verbs was often extended to 
the plural already in ME. Then this a being in an open 
syllable became lengthened and was afterwards levelled 
out into the singular ; so that the preterites with ee in this 
and the fifth class are really generalized plural stem-forms. 
The old pret. pi. form with se (e) would have become 1 in 
the dialect, § 130. On the other hand, brak is the old sing, 
form. The same is also the case with the a in the pret. of 
verbs of Class V.

B. Weak Verbs. 

§ 380. The weak verbs are best classified according to 
their formation of the preterite and past participle. We 
thus distinguish three classes : — 1. -ed, 2. -d, 3. -t. 



140 



VERBS. 



[§§380,381. 



Paragraphs 381-3 contain a fairly complete list of 
verbs which either differ from literary English in the 
preterite and past participle, or are interesting from other 
points of view. When the pret. or pp. has two forms, the 
less usual one is enclosed in brackets. 



Class I. 

§ 381. The preterite and past participle generally take 
-ed when the present ends in -t or -d. But a few verbs 
with short stem-vowels, whose present ends in -t, have the 
same form in the pret. and past participle ; and a few 
others with a long stem vowel in the present have a short 
vowel in the pret. and pp.

When I was a boy pret. and pp. forms like bent, bled, 
led, spent, etc., were hardly ever heard, but through the 
spread of elementary education they are now much used, 
especially among the younger generation, and will no doubt 
in the course of time entirely supplant the other forms. 
In like manner the strong pp. kesn, putn, fretn, etc., were 
far more common twenty years ago than they are now. 

Forms like let lit, lighted, belt have been formed after 
the analogy of such pret. as met, red, etc., where the vowel 
was shortened before the double consonants (e.g. pret. 
mette) already in ME. 



Class II. 

§ 382. The preterite and past participle generally take 
-d when the present ends in a voiced sound other than -d.

Verbal Endings. 
§ 384. 

Present : The first person singular and the whole of the 
plural generally have no special endings, except when the 
subject of the sentence is a relative pronoun. See § 395, p. 
156. The second and third persons singular end in -ez, -z, -s. 
-ez is used after the spirants s, z, s, z, as misez missest, 
misses, raizez risest, rises, wisez wishest, wishes, sinzez 
singest, singes ; -z after voiced sounds, as weivz iveavest, 
weaves, lenz lendest, lends, duz dost, does ; -s after other 
voiceless sounds, as elps helpest, helps, weks workest, works, 
eits eatest, eats. 

On the personal endings of the verbs have and be, see 

§§ 395> 6 - 

Preterite : The singular and plural of strong verbs have 

no special endings. The singular and plural of weak verbs 

end in -ed, -d, -t for all persons. See §§ 380, 385. 

Participles : The present participle ends in -in (§§ 276, 

385). The past participle of strong verbs ends in vocalic 

-n after dentals (§ 269), -» after gutturals (§ 271), and -m 

after labials (§ 270). The past participle of weak verbs 

ends in -ed, -d, -t. See §§ 381-3.

kud, ked are used both as an infin. and past part., 
unless, as is more probable, the use of kud, ked, in such 
cases, is due to the contamination of two constructions, as a 
ius te kud or ked diut 7" icsed to be able to do it, ad e dunt 
if id kud (never ked) i" would have done it if I had been 
able. 

2. dare. 
§ 390. This verb presents no special peculiarities. I shall 
therefore only give the first person singular of each tense in 
use. The final t regularly disappears in the pret. before 
the following negative. A weak form de only occurs in the

There is no difference in meaning between the weak 
forms s, st and si, sed, but only in usage. The former are 
never used except in combination with the personal pro- 
nouns, as aset bi te-moon I shall have it by to-morrow, 
8est e guen if t5ed kud they should have gone if they had 
been able, tmen si (never s) et the men shall have it, Si fa$e 
sed gim(e) e feu thy father should give me a few. But the 
difference in use between s and si, st and sed in combina- 
tion with pronouns seems to be due to sentence rhythm. 

4. must. 

§ 392. To express lit. Engl, must, we have two words 
which are never confounded in use : 

1 . Strong form mun, weak men which expresses a neces- 
sity dependent upon the will of a person, as a men get mi 
wak duin bi te-nit / must get my work done by to-night, 
je men tel im wen e kumz et as bi bak ina you must tell 
him vohen he comes that I shall be back presently, mun i 
gue wi je ? must I go with you ? 

mun, men is sometimes used to express may, can, as tSa 
men J?ir>k wot te laiks bed tSal e te diut you may think 
what you like but you will have to do it, mun tSe stop ? 
may mean either must they stop? or may they stop? 

The weak form med (§ 393), which generally means 
might, is also used as a preterite of mun, as su sed tSe med 
oetSer eit tSat e diu bat out she said they must either eat 
that or do without anything. 

mun is of Norse origin, 0. Icel. inf. mono, later munu

other road, the latter that they are under personal restraint

The plural forms of the present, given above, are only 
used in combination with the personal pronouns, in other 
cases we use ez, ez, z, s (after voiceless consonants) just as 
in the second and third person singular, as <5em menz bin 
vari guid te me those men have been very good to me, tladz 
ez gen me sumet the boys have given me something, uz ets 
dun se mits for im we who have done so much for him, ez cSem 
men sin Se ? have those men seen theel es taplz guen bad ? 
have the apples gone bad? The same also applies to the 
first person, as its mi ets dunt it is I who have done it, mi 
ets ed se mits te baid I who have had so much to endure. 

The endings -z, -s for the whole of the singular and 
plural are now chiefly confined to the verbs have and be 
(except the second person singular). 

With other verbs we now generally only use these 
endings in combination with the relative pronoun et, as 
Sem men diu tSe wak vari wil those men do their work very 
well ; but t5emz tmen et duz tSe wak tbest those are the men 
who do their work the best. Although this is the normal 
usage, I have often heard the -z, -s forms used under the 
same circumstances as they are for the verb have. In the 
older stage of the dialect the endings -z, -s must have been 
used for all verbs in the manner they are still used for 
have. Already in OE. the Northern dialects had the plural 
ending -as beside -acS, e. g. bindas beside bindatS. 

As it may possibly interest some readers to learn how 
far the plural endings -z and -s extend, I have examined the 
Comparative dialect specimens in Ellis, EEPr. v. The 



§395-1 VERBS. 157 

second and sixth sentences contain the point in question. 
The sentences are : (2) ' Few men die because they are 
laughed at.' In the dialect specimens this is often rendered 
as if it were : 'there are few men who die because they are 
laughed at.' In the statistics given below, this sentence 
will be referred to as without relative and ending, without 
relative with ending, with relative and no ending, with 
relative and ending. The sixth sentence is : (6) ' And the 
old woman herself will tell any of you that laugh now.'

ending. East Northern : at South Ainsty and Holderness

(6) rel. with ending -s ; at Hawes, Kirkby, Lonsdale, Dent, 
Sedburg, Kendal, Orton, Kirkby Stephen, Crosby Ravens-

Coniston, Long Sleddale, Temple Sowerby, Clifton, Holme 
Cultram, Carlisle, and Knaresdale without rel. and ending ; 
at Milburn, Ellonby, and Upper Swaledale with rel. and

with ending -s except at Coniston, where we have with reL 
and no ending. North Northern : at South Shields (6) with 
rel. and ending -s ; at Newcastle and Berwick-upon-Tweed 
without rel. and ending, and (6) with rel. and no ending. 
The Lowland division : at Bewcastle, Hawick, Edinburgh,

ending -z, but (6) with rel. and ending -s ; at Stranraer and 
Wick without rel. and ending, but for (6) with rel. and no 
ending. The above are the only comparative specimens of 
the Lowland division given in Ellis. But Dr. Murray, The 
Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland, pp. 21 1-2, 
states that the plural and first pers. singular without -s are 
only used when the verb is accompanied by its proper 
pronoun; when the subject is a noun, adjective, interroga- 
tive or relative pronoun, or when the verb and subject are 
separated by a clause, the verb takes the termination -s in 
all persons. Dr. Murray informs me that the persons who 



l6o VEBBS. [§§395,396. 

supplied Dr. Ellis with the comparative specimens for 
Stranraer and Wick have given inaccurate versions with 
regard to the verbal endings. The probability is that Dr. 
Ellis has misunderstood the versions, because in a note 
(p. 683) he distinctly says that he took down the two 
versions hurriedly, and was afraid that some of the finer 
shades might have escaped him. 

c. be. 

§ 396. The vowel disappears in the weak forms of the 
present, and when followed by a consonant the verb dis- 
appears altogether in the plural, as wil gue wen tot redi 
we will go when thou art ready, tSer at it egien they are at 
it again ; but tSe ban uem they are going home, W9 selin em 
et oepni e kweot we are selling them at a halfpenny a 
quart. The -z in the third person becomes -s before and 
after voiceless consonants, as tbried et te bouts nuen guid 
the bread which thou boughtest is not good, ses Jnwkin e 
gu(e)in she is thinking of going.

In forms like atnt art not, wornt tuas, were not, the n is

The above forms of the present are mostly used in com-

use iz, 9z, z. s, cp. § 395, as tkoilz iznt dun jot the coals

§ 397. Present, strong form wil, weak 9l which loses 
its vowel in combination with the pronouns. 



§397.] VEEBS. 163 

Preterite, strong form wod, weak forms wed, ed, the

ed fots it, if je ast em the lads ivould fetch it, if you asked

to be formerly wont or willing to do a thing, as tSe ius te 
wed elp me na en 'Sen they were formerly wont or willing 
to help me now and then, wod is also in common use as a

Adverbs, Prepositions, and Conjunctions. 

I. ADVEEBS. 

§ 399. i. Adverbs of manner and degree: The adverbs 
of manner mostly end in -li, as adli hardly, oekedli awk- 
wardly ; but we have the stress on the suffix in siueli 
surely, ekuedinlai accordingly. 

a how, a-ivo(r) old people say amive(r) however which 
seems to have been contaminated with asemive(r) howsoever, 
with the particle sem = the O. Dan. sum, 0. Icel. sem ; apm 
(lit. happen), me bi perhaps, nobed lit. not but, only, oles 
always, omest almost, tiu too, also (instead of tiu we very 
often use en oel lit. and all, it wor e vari guidn en oel it 
was a very good one too, aim ban on oel / am going too), 
vari very, wil well. But when well begins the sentence we 
use wel just as in lit. Engl., as wel, a niver ied sits en e 
J?ir> i oel mi boon deez ivell, I never heard such (an) a 
thing in all my bom days ; but its oel vari wil it is all very 
ivell, suz nuen se wil te-dee she is not very well to-day. 

sue, weak form se so. Instead of sue we often use (Sat, as 
i we Sat mad he ivas so angry, se we Sat week wol se kudnt 
stand she was so weak that (lit. ivhile) she could not stand. 

The adverbs also, thus, why are not used. To express 



§§ 399-401.1 APPENDIX. 167 

also we use tiu, 011 oel, thus is i <5is wee, and why, wot 
fo(r), wots o guen fo(r) ? why has he gone ?, a duent noe 
wot ez dun Sat fo(r) 7 efon'tf fowoitf ivhy he has done that. 

Adverbs of place : oniwie(r) anywhere, ie(r) here, ioe(r), 
hither, jondo(r) yonder, sumwie(r) somewhere, oie(r) (weak 
forms oe(r), 'Se(r)) ^ere, wie(r) where. 

Adverbs of time : ina bye-and-bye, presently, bina % 
tffo's £i??ie, ive(r) ever, jestede yesterday, jestenit last night, 
jet yet, na now, nive(r) never, oft often, sin siwce, suin soon, 
to-dee to-day, te-moon to-morrow, te-moen-tnit to-morrow 
(the) night, te-nit to-night, cSen then, wen when. 

Affirmative and negative particles : ai yes (jes is also used 
but it is not so common as ai), nee no (nou no has been 
borrowed from the literary language), net not (instead of net 
we often use nuen) ; cp. § 357. 

2. PREPOSITIONS.

SPECIMENS. 



It was originally my intention not to give any speci- 
mens of the dialect in this volume, but to reserve them for 
a second which was to contain a complete glossary of 
such dialect words as are not in use in the Modern literary 
language, together with extensive specimens of the dialect. 
With this end in view I have been collecting materials for 
a great number of years ; but various circumstances pre- 
vent me from entertaining the hope of being able to 
publish them for some years to come. I have therefore 
decided to give a few specimens in the present volume, 
trusting that they may be found useful to those readers 
who may wish to make themselves familiar with the 
dialect. To anyone who takes the trouble to read them 
I venture to say that they will be found both amusing and 
instructive. 

There is a great quantity of stories and poems printed 
in the dialect, but as they stand they are practically 
worthless for the purposes of this book. The transcrip- 
tion is neither accurate nor consistent. All the specimens 
given here are from printed sources. To number III. 
I have added the original in order to show the kind of 
transcription usually employed in such books. 

The sources are : — III. (The Yorkshireman's Comic An- 
nual, 1884, pp. 37-38), IV. (ditto, 1885, pp. 14-17), V. 
(ditto, 1882, pp. 24-26), VI. (Yorkshire Sketches, by Wil- 
liam Cudworth, pp. 1 1— 17), VII., VIII, IX. (Dialect and 
other Poems, by Ben Preston, pp. 31-33, 11-12, 1-10).

1. Well, neighbour, you and he may both laugh at this 
news of mine. Who cares? That is neither here nor 
there. 

2. Few men die because they are laughed at, we know, 
don't we ? what should make them ? It is not very likely, 
is it? 

3- Howsoever these are the facts of the case, so just hold 
your [din] noise, friend, and be quiet till I have done. 
Hearken !

those folks who went through the whole thing from the 
first themselves, — that did I, [sure] safe enough, — 

5. That the j^oungest son himself, a great [lad] boy of 
nine, knew his father's voice at once, though it ivas so 
queer and squeaking, and I would trust him to speak the 
truth any day, aye, I ivould [that]. 

6. And the old woman herself will tell any of you that 
laugh now, and tell you straight off, too, without much 
bother, if you will only ask her, oh ! won't she ? — 

7. [at any rate] leastways she told it me when I asked 
her, two or three times over, did she, and she ought not

Dialect Test. 

See Ellis, p. 8*, and compare the version given below with the one in Ellis 
(p. 389), which contains several strange mistakes both in the version and 
the notes to it. If his rendering of the dialect test of other dialect speakers 
is as inaccurate as that of the Windbill dialect, the value of these tests 
for phonetic and philological purposes is not very great. The classified 
word list (pp. 391-4) also contains many mistakes. The only way in 
which I can account for these inaccuracies is partly through the hurried 
manner in which the dial, test and classified word-list were taken down 
and partly through their not having been revised.

NOTES. 

The (•) denotes that the following syllable has the strong 
stress, thus asenrive (I. 3), 'aim (I. 4). Before beginning 
the Specimens the reader is advised to read over §§ 249, 260, 
341, 350 in the Grammar. In order to facilitate the reading 
of the Specimens, I have written get up instead of ger up, 
wot iz it ? instead of wor iz it ? etc. See § 290.

struction only occurs in subordinate sentences, and has 
probably arisen from contamination with such phrases as, 
sud or sed e dunt she would have done it ; tladz ed 9 guen 
the boys ivould have gone. We generally say ad e lend jet 
if jed nobed e ast me I would have lent you it, if you had 
only (have) asked me. Cp. the end of §§ 389, 397. 48,
